# Modern AI Workflow with Claude Code, Vercel, and Aiven

A comprehensive guide and workflow for building full-stack applications using AI-assisted development with Claude Code, serverless deployment via Vercel, and managed PostgreSQL databases with Aiven.

## Overview

This repository documents a complete workflow for rapidly prototyping and deploying production-ready applications using modern AI-assisted development tools. The workflow was developed through building a V2MOM (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Measures) management system for high-growth SaaS companies.

## Technology Stack

- **AI Development:** Claude Code CLI for AI-assisted coding
- **Database:** Aiven PostgreSQL (managed cloud database)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js REST API
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel (both API and frontend)
- **Version Control:** GitHub with automated deployment
